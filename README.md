# Coursera machine learning

This course wantds to show how Machine Learning can be used to solve problems and its limitation. We are going also going to learn about how embedded systems,
such as single board computers and microcontrollers can be effectively used to solve problems and créate new types of computer interfaces. 

### WEEK 1

When we think of machine learning, we usually think of powerful servers crunching tons of data in order to do things like filter out spam emails, recommend movies for us to watch and predict traffic patterns during our commute.

The prerequisites that we should be fmiliar with are the algebra and Arduino. To complete the course, we will need a modern smartphone with a browser and optionlly, the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board. 
An Embeded system is any computer system that is contained or embedded inside of another larger mechanical or electrical system. 
In the next picture, it shows the calification of a Little test of five questions: the first one, talks about how the AI is only concerned with the designing and building of intelligent agents that receive precepts from the environment and discover patterns in that environment, wich is false,  for something to be considered AI, it must take action that affect that environment. The second question was aboutclassification being a supervised learning for Machine Learning. The third one was about how the training pase is where the model’s parameters get updated. About the fourth question its about how the mchine learning models are prone to biases in the data. The last question, and the most interesting one in my opinión, was about how on an AI system it important to build a societal trust with ethical, in order to maintain a leve lof fairness.

The first part of this point, shows us the importance of single board computers. 
So that, they have more powerful microprocessor with separate memory. 
This characteristic can make them capable of running a full operating system like Linux,
and also provide a full user interface. Unlike microcontrollers, 
these are much cheaper but les powerful.  

In the next picture, we can se the differences between single board computer and microcontrollers:

Moving to another subject, we also learned about tinyML, wich responds to Tiny Machine Learning. It can be defined as a Dynamic field os computer science that has permeated nearly every digital thing that we interact with. It can be social media, our cell pones, our cars… 
Machine learning itself can be a technology that utilizes algorithms called “neural networks” to teach a computer to recognize patterns. As we can see in the next picture:

With this course, we learned that tinyML can be classified inte three domains: vibration, voice and visión. Vibration includes control and localization, voice include systems with microphones and visión includes system recognizing. Al lof these three domains or 3D’s have different workload performance requirments and demand scalable solutions.
As in all the points of this course, at the end of these, we have a small questionnaire about the information we saw. In the next picture, there is the mark obtained:
