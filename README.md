Coursera machine learning

This course wantds to show how Machine Learning can be used to solve problems and its limitation. We are going also going to learn about how embedded systems, such as single board computers and microcontrollers can be effectively used to solve problems and cr√©ate new types of computer interfaces. 

WEEK 1
Introduction to Machine Learning
When we think of machine learning, we usually think of powerful servers crunching tons of data in order to do things like filter out spam emails, recommend movies for us to watch and predict traffic patterns during our commute.

The prerequisites that we should be fmiliar with are the algebra and Arduino. To complete the course, we will need a modern smartphone with a browser and optionlly, the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board. 

Embedded Machine Learning
An Embeded system is any computer system that is contained or embedded inside of another larger mechanical or electrical system. 
In the next picture, it shows the calification of a Little test of five questions: the first one, talks about how the AI is only concerned with the designing and building of intelligent agents that receive precepts from the environment and discover patterns in that environment, wich is false,  for something to be considered AI, it must take action that affect that environment. The second question was aboutclassification being a supervised learning for Machine Learning. The third one was about
